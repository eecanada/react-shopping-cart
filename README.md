# Description

- This is a React.js shopping cart I built that resembles the shopping cart functionality and look of an e-commerce shoe business called the [The Noble Shoe](https://www.thenobleshoe.com/).

# Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- CSS3
- HTML5
- React
- Bootstrap
- Netlify

# Getting Started

[Click to visit page](https://react-shopping-cart-shoes.netlify.app/)

- The user clicks on the link above and loads a page with four shoes in their shopping cart.

- Users can add more quantities of any shoe, and even reduce the quantity to zero. If the quantity is zero, then the minus button disables, not allowing the user to have a negative amount of shoes.

- As the user adds or removes shoes, the total price of that select show will dynamically update along with the total price of the whole cart

# Next Steps

- Use Stripe API to allow users to checkout.
- Create a function where if the quantity of shoes is zero, dynamically remove the shoe from the cart.
